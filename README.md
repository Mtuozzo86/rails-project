## Another blog app?

You bet! I'm sure you're tired of seeing them, but here comes another! For the up and coming software developer looking to understand the ins and outs of front-end and back-end coding, nothing is better than the blog app. Here at ThoughtSpace, you can do what you could always do and much less than the big name sites like Medium.com, but where's the fun in that? Support your local mom and pop shops and create an account here. If you're username is unique you can login and post as much as you want and see an entire community of 3 or 4 people to share your thoughts with.

But remember, only you can edit and delete what YOU write. You can't edit or delete anyone else's thoughts. And to make life easier, you're sure to be happy when you exit the page without logging out, knowing that you'll still be logged in and ready to tell everyone how you feel the next time you join us here at ThoughtSpace.
